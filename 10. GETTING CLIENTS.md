# Means of outreach
1. Cold Outreach(strangers)
2. Warm Outreach(known people)

# There are two ways to get clients
1. Instagram
2. Email
3. LinkedIn, Upwork, Fiverr(GAY and COMPETING WITH THIRD-WORLDERS)


# Who are you reaching out to?
1. Businesses
2. Influencers

# Reaching out on Instagram:
### 1. Make sure your profile is decent
- Plenty of pictures
- Profile picture

- Follow them and send them a message
- Send the a cold DM using this script

>  Yo Buster, I love the content man. Just breezed over your page and there's some gaps in your marketing I've spotted,... mind if I shoot something over that may help?

- Stroke their ego
- Like a few of their pics
- Comment on their pics
- Basically make yourself KNOWN.

## When they reply,...
1. Make a Google Doc..., explaining what they need fixing
2. Do they have an email list?, are their email's good? is their welcome email quick?   > timestamp 1:23:45
3. 9/10 times, they'll reply "Super appreciate that"
4. Give them your email
5. Get them on a call(because it's more personal)  [[calendly.com]] because  it shows  you're pro and it saves time.

# Reaching out on Email:
1. Find the clients
2. Finding the decision maker's email
3. Sending the email
4. REPEAT

## Use Apollo.io
1. Make an account
2. Search for a random word( e.g. what you're passionate about or good at)
3. For CEO's email, DM "@tombeenhamm" "CHAT"
4. Then shoot the email

> "Hey x, was looking for something to buy my x and found you guys! Love what you're doing. Keep u the great work!"


## Tips for Email
1. Buy a domain - They'll take you more seriously 
2. Don't spam - Quality>Quantity 
3. Be patient

## The ==**#1 reason**== why mf's don't succeed is because:
- They don't do outreach (Do at least 40-100 DM's and emails a day).
