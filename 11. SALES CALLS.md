After outreach and Calendly, get them on a call

Use **Zoom**

It's the best.


1. First 5 minutes
2. Back and forth conversation, introductions etc.
3. Nothing crazy 

**Take control of the call** 

4. It's not an interview, it's and interaction

> "Before I get into that, do you mind me asking a few questions so I get a list of what you're running rn?"
	(let them brag about themselves for 10 minutes )

5. Begin asking them the ***HIIT*** questions 

>**H - How long have you been doing this?**
>
>**I - Is there a place you wanna be in a year**
>
>**I - Is there something stopping you?**
>
>**T - Then what happens if you don't fix it?**

Take them on an emotional ride, that's why 
sales calls with chicks is soo … easy😆( they're emotionally led)

6. Control the frame of the call
7. NEVER...,
   EVER...,
   Be the one to bring up price.
   Wait for them to, they're not idiots...

## PAYMENT

- Stripe (Invoices)
- Bank Transfer (best for intra-native)
- Paypal (not the best because it's reversible)
- Bitcoin 
- Blowjobs 😏
- ANYTHING - NEVER SAY NOTHING TO 

For a monthly retainer of $1000 of course

## If they say no:

### *NEVER DROP YOUR PRICE* 
### *EVER!*

### Drop the total package 

Ask them
Me 😎: "How much would you be willing to invest?"

Dickhead Rep: "$700"

Me 😎: "Sure, for $700 instead of doing all your Emails, ads and captions, I'll do emails and captions"


## Before the call:
- Do background checks
- Don't go in blind, do background checks

## Post call Etiquette:
- Get paid on call - but it isn't over yet.
- Handle "Post-buyer's remorse"
- Say WHAT is gonna happen after the call
