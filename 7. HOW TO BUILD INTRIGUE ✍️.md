It's fundamental to get attention, 
It's what makes the ***best movies*** the ***best***

Methods to improve include: 

## 1. Ask questions 
 - "Are you..."
 - 
 Usually in the **opening line** or **subject line**.
 It changes the dynamic of the interaction. It makes it seem like the page is ***speaking to you directly...

**Example:

 
## 2.  Use numbers (because they stand out )

## 3.  Open loops
- Start by telling someone something and make wait to find the rest... 

For example:
> Here's how to bang 9's every day of the week ...
> 
> In the next 5 minutes I'm going to reveal how to take half time hotties to bed like clockwork with "one simple 9 word pickup line"
> 
> A line that can be learned off by heart and used in minutes...
> 
> John here used it and here's what he had to say since implementing it...


## 4. Gimmick
  A play on words...
 You could say "Buy this book to lose weight "
 
OR

"Purchase our book and learn the ***drop 40 in 40 method*** to melt body fat in mere days..."
