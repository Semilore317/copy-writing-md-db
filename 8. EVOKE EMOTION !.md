# How to evoke emotion
Use descriptive writing and specific examples:

The more the reader feels heard, the more they'll develop an affiliation with the words... and the more emotion will be evoked.

Example:
If I'm trying to get a fat fuck to get into a fitness program, I could say:

"Steven, i know you're fat , so you should buy my book which would help you lose weight"

OR

"Hey Steven, does this sound familiar:,
You wake up in the morning, you get out of the bed,
the first thing you do is look in the mirror, you're faced with disgust,
your room stinks(not because of the perfume from the girls you've been banging, but because of your leftover food you're too lazy to take to the kitchen), and you snore a lot because you're drowning in neck fat.

What if â€¦,it didn't have to be that way Steven,
what if you could wake up to 2 hotties on either side and your bed smells like Victoria perfume and instead of it smelling of fvcking deliveroos, it smells of *pussy*,

how would you feel?,
we've had loads of people in that situation and transformed their lives,
